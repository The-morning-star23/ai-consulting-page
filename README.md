# AI Consulting Landing Page - Matrix 360 Challenge

A high-performance, mobile-responsive landing page built for the Matrix 360 AI Developer screening. This project demonstrates modern frontend practices and efficient AI-assisted development.

## Tech Stack
* **React** (Vite)

## Project Features
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes.
* **Functional Contact Form:** Integrated with a headless API to deliver emails without a dedicated backend.
* **Performance:** Optimized assets and minimal bundle size via Vite.

## AI Development Log
* **Tool Used:** Gemini / ChatGPT.
* **Time Saved:** AI saved approximately 3 hours of manual work by generating the boilerplate Tailwind configurations and streamlining the form submission logic. It allowed me to focus on UI polish and responsiveness rather than writing repetitive CSS.
